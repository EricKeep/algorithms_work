# Minimal difference

Originally used to find the minimal difference in spliting a team of players such that the difference in total weight was minimal, this program takes
a sequence of numbers and splits them up such that the difference in sum between the two groups is as small as possible.

Two test files are included

Only sequences of numbers of even lengths will be accepted by the program

Input can be entered via either the keyboard or from a filename passed as an argument

i.e. ./minimal_subsequence test1.dat
